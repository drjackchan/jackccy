Hi 👋🏻, I'm Jack 陳羲文 (超揚). As a fintech/web3 tech lead, book author, designer, and educator, my expertise spans various domains. I have authored the book 📙 Python API Development Fundamentals, which is a comprehensive guide to building RESTful APIs with Python. Being a passionate learner, I travel a lot ✈️, exploring new cultures and meeting new people. I have multiple side projects (or experiments) ongoing that you may find interesting, such as building blockchain-based applications or developing new businesses. My life philosophy is to always be learning and sharing knowledge with others.
