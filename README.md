Hi, it's Jack here. By day, Iâ€™m a project manager in an investment bank. By night, I work as a developer, author, designer and educator. I am the author of the book ðŸ“™ Python API Development Fundamentals, a blogger at Money Tao. I have multiple side projects (or experiments) going on that you may find interesting. I love learning and sharing. I explore how to get the most out of life.
